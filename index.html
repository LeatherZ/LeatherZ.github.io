<h1>LeatherZ Closing Announcement</h1>

<p><strong>As of today, February 1, 2026, LeatherZ is closed.</strong></p>

<p>
LeatherZ (pronounced "Leather Zee") was started by Jon Maddux. Jon sold the company's
first product, a black Mark1 Z3 armrest in October of 1998 and the business grew steadily ever since.
</p>

<p>
In 2001, Jon’s brother Andy took over LeatherZ. Over the following 25 years, LeatherZ became a
pillar of the BMW Z3 and Z4 roadster and coupe communities; providing high quality products that
were developed, manufactured and finished all in-house. The guiding principle was to not sell
a product that you would not use in your own car.
</p>

<p>
Beginning in 2025, we began to make plans to ramp down production on many products with the
goal of closing LeatherZ by the fall of 2025. It has taken us a little longer to get there, but the
time has finally come to move on to new adventures in life.
</p>

<p>
Please look at our eBay Storefront as we are listing the remaining stock of products.
</p>

<p>
From both of the Maddux brothers, thank you for a wonderful 27 years.
</p>
